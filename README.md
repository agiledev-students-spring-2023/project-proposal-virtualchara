# Project Proposal

### Project title

Virtual Chara

### What and why?

Nowadays, a bunch of VTubers emerges on the internet, suggesting  a new way of communication between people who are seeking a way to escape the reality and want to reborn as a completely new character in virtual world.

I want to build a web app in which you could create your own Avatar fiction characters and use them to do role playing online through daily chatting and board games (especially games such as DND).

### For whom?

People who want to be completely anonymous on the internet and enjoy role playing online


### How?

In the app, everyone has an account in which you could create and store your own Avatar fiction characters. 
In the web app, there are a bunch of features that could help you build the characters. 
For basic functionalities, you could upload image of the character, type in basic information about it, and build up his/her stories. 
After you finish building up the character(s) you want to use in your role playing, you could use any of them as your avatar mask to play board games with people online (for example, DND) or do daily chatting.


### Scope

The project is not too hard nor too easy because it not only requires the simple implementation of database and programming web features, but also will meet a lot of challenges in building up chat rooms and implementing online board games.
